II.	Basis for Jurisdiction

	Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction (limited power).  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, federal courts may 	hear cases in which a citizen of one State sues a citizen of another State or nation and the amount at stake is 	more than $75,000.  In that kind of case, called a diversity of citizenship case, no defendant may be a citizen of 	the same State as any plaintiff.  Explain how these jurisdictional requirements have been met.

			State of (name)	     	.

			under the laws of the State of (name)	     	,
			and has its principal place of business in the State of (name)
	     	.

		(If more than one plaintiff is named in the complaint, attach an additional page providing the 			same information for each additional plaintiff.)

	B.	The Defendant(s)

		1.	If the defendant is an individual
			The defendant,  (name)	     	, is a citizen of 
			the State of (name) 	     				.  Or is a citizen of
			 (foreign nation)	     	.

		2. 	If the defendant is a corporation
			The defendant,  (name)	     	, is incorporated under
			the laws of the State of (name)	     	, and has its
			principal place of business in the State of (name)	     	.
			Or is incorporated under the laws of (foreign nation)	     	,
			and has its principal place of business in (name) 	     	.

		(If more than one defendant is named in the complaint, attach an additional page providing the 			same information for each additional defendant.)

	C.	The Amount in Controversy

State how each defendant was 	involved and what each defendant did that caused the plaintiff harm or violated the plaintiff's rights, including 	the dates and places of that involvement or conduct.  If more than one claim is asserted, number each claim and 	write a short and plain statement of each claim in a separate paragraph.  Attach additional pages if needed.

	The plaintiff, (name) 	     	, and the defendant,
	(name) 	     	, made an agreement or contract on
	(date) 	     	.  The agreement or contract was (oral or written)		.  Under that

Include any basis for claiming that the wrongs alleged are continuing at the present time.  Include 	the amounts of any actual damages claimed for the acts alleged and the basis for these amounts.  Include any 	punitive or exemplary damages claimed, the amounts, and the reasons you claim you are entitled to actual or 	punitive money damages.
	     

V.	Certification and Closing

		I agree to provide the Clerk’s Office with any changes to my address where caserelated papers may be 		served.  I understand that my failure to keep a current address on file with the Clerk’s Office may result 		in the dismissal of my case.
